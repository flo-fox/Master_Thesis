# Introduction

Note: Since this script serves as exploratory data analysis with respect to the research question, I use the `data` data set, i. e. the data set running until 2021. In the paper, I only use data until 2014. For the LaTeX export, I obviously limit the data set to the data used in the analysis scripts.

  sapply(., function(x) table(x, useNA = "always"))
```

# Bivariate descriptive statistics



Display correlation between standard council size (as determined (by me) by council size) with actual number of seats. (On the overall sample `data`:) Especially weak in Baden-Württemberg, North-Rhine Westphalia, and Saxony. Strong in Saarland (sharp design here), Thuringia, and Brandenburg (though few data points here).

```{r, rows.print=15}
data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), seat_cor = cor(total_seats, by_law_seats, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")) %>%
  arrange(seat_cor)
# Main data set used in analysis
d_rdd_bivariate2 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), seat_cor = cor(total_seats, by_law_seats, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")) %>%
  arrange(seat_cor)
cor(d_rdd_bivariate2$total_seats, d_rdd_bivariate2$by_law_seats, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
# Main data set used in analysis & close to cutoffs
d_rdd_bivariate2 %>%
  filter(closest <= 0.1) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), seat_cor = cor(total_seats, by_law_seats, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")) %>%
  arrange(seat_cor)
cor(d_rdd_bivariate2 %>% filter(closest <= 0.1) %>% pull(total_seats),

# Investigating covariate imbalance

Three RDD covariates have been shown to have a statistically significant jump at the threshold. Dummy "kreisfreie_stadt" and the share of population of working aged > 65 jump positively, the population share of working-age people jumps negatively.

```{r}
d_rdd_balance_test <- data %>%
  select(
    ln_gross_expenditure_pc, total_seats, inhabs_rel_to_cutoff, above_cutoff,
    inhabitants_treshold_factor, inhabitants_treshold, year, ags, election_year, state, # standard variables
    inh_tot, pop_over65, unempl_rate, total_area_ha,
    share_working_age, kreisfreie_stadt, stadt, lag_total_seats # Balance test variables
    ) %>%
  drop_na(ln_gross_expenditure_pc, total_seats, inhabs_rel_to_cutoff) %>%
  mutate(across(c(kreisfreie_stadt, stadt), ~ as.numeric(.)-1))
```
```{r}
d_rdd_balance_test %>%
  select(-c(inhabitants_treshold_factor, year, ags)) %>%
  cor(., use = "pairwise.complete.obs") %>%
